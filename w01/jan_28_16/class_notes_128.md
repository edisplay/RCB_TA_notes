make a repo in github
in terminal, make a connection between git and github
	- type: "git init" from the folder you're using. initialize the folder
	- now tell git where you're pushing code to. "git remote add origin " + name_of_repo (usually a url)
	ex. git remote add origin http://github.com/rachellefaroul/RCBWeek1.git
	- "git remote show origin" fetch and push should be the same
now want to pull the code as it exists from the repo
	- git pull origin master
	- git add page1.html (or whatever the file name is)
	- git commit -m "wjiorejwo"
	- git push origin master

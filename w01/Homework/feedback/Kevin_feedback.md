1. Awesome job overall! I like that you added your own touch with the background and fonts.  
2. GREAT JOB recognizing that the html and css for the home page could be used as a template for the other two pages. 
3. In the future, separate your reset.css file content from the others. It decreases the likelihood that your defaults will get messed with.
4. In your css file, check out the values for the h1. You have two of them. This may be why your header doesn't span the width of the page and why your pages is scrolling, left to right.
5. try to make your class and id names more semantic. Instead of "nonmsgbox", name it "senderName" or "senderEmail". It makes it easier for people working on your team to edit/read your code. 
6. You're off to a great start on your portfolio!

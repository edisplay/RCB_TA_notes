1. Awesome job overall! I'm impressed with how logically your site is laid out. You obviously spent a lot of time thinking about how to contain elements in html and you've got a firm understanding of how to group elements in css.
2. GREAT JOB recognizing that the html and css for the home page could be used as a template for the other two pages. 
3.. Very cool use of the "hr" tag! Way to think outside the box. Another solution is to add a border-bottom in your css to the h1.
4. Your indentations are awesome! Thank you so much. It makes your code easy to read. If you're ever helping a fellow student with their code, please share this tip with them!
5. I noticed that you tried to add the pipes in between the navigation items. For practice, try using pseudo classes in css. Look at this for reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9171699/add-a-pipe-separator-after-items-in-an-unordered-list-unless-that-item-is-the-la
6. Congrats again!

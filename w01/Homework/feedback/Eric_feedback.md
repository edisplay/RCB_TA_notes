1. Awesome job overall! GREAT JOB recognizing that the html and css for the home page could be used as a template for the other two pages. 
- In general, your HTML file should only be used to layout the page. no styling should happen in the HTML file. Any centering, altering the fonts, etc. should be done in your css file. For example, see this: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_center.asp. W3Schools and Mozilla are great resources for learning about HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
3. One reason why you may have had trouble styling your header and top links is because they're stuck inside the head tag. "head" is NOT the same as "header". 
4. Your indentations are awesome! Thank you so much. It makes your code easy to read. If you're ever helping a fellow student with their code, please share this tip with them!
5. Also, pay attention to your closing tags. Sublime helps you out by pointing out when you've successfully closed your tags. You should see a squiggly line under each opening and closing tag if it's closed correctly. One reason why you couldn't move or style the sidebar properly may be that your sidebar div isn't closed properly.

1. Awesome job overall! I'm impressed with how logically your site is laid out. You obviously spent a lot of time thinking about how to contain elements in html and you've got a firm understanding of how to group elements in css.
2. GREAT JOB recognizing that the html and css for the home page could be used as a template for the other two pages. 
3. Your indentations are awesome! Thank you so much. It makes your code easy to read. If you're ever helping a fellow student with their code, please share this tip with them!
4. Pay attention to your closing tags. Sublime helps you out by pointing out when you've successfully closed your tags. You should see a squiggly line under each opening and closing tag if it's closed correctly. Check out your "body" tag - it's closed, but you never opened it.
5. Also, in css, instead of giving the header and footer a pixel width, try giving them a width of 100%. That way, it'll be the width of the browser no matter how wide it is.
6. Congrats! This is awesome.

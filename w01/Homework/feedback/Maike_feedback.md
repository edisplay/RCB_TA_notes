1. Awesome job overall! I'm impressed with how logically your site is laid out. You obviously spent a lot of time thinking about how to contain elements in html and you've got a firm understanding of how to group elements in css.
2. GREAT JOB recognizing that the html and css for the home page could be used as a template for the other two pages. 
3. I like your solution for adding the pipes to the nav (and parentheses, too!). For practice, instead of using the non-breaking space, try using pseudo classes in css. Look at this for reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9171699/add-a-pipe-separator-after-items-in-an-unordered-list-unless-that-item-is-the-la
4. Now that you've done the homework, feel free to go back and change the design, the layout, etc.

1. GREAT JOB recognizing that the html and css for the home page could be used as a template for the other two pages.
2. Pay attention to your closing tags. Sublime helps you out by pointing out when you've successfully closed your tags. You should see a squiggly line under each opening and closing tag if it's closed correctly. One reason why you couldn't move or style divs may be because some of them aren't closed properly. Also, watch out for capitalization. You NEVER capitalize the first character of an element in html (look at your closing p tag on line 36 of your index.html file).
3. your css file is well-structured; Awesome work. You have a good understanding of how to target elements in css. I'm going to ask that you share that knowledge with other folks sitting around you. It's a great skill.
4. We can chat more next week about improving your page, but for now try giving your entire "body" tag a background of the cool grey image, making your "header" background white, and your "name" div that cool teal color.  See if that changes anything.
5. Congrats on the assignment!

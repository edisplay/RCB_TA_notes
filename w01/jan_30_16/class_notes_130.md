Calculate the width and height of the blue #box div (554 x 569)

#box {
  background-color: #1E5792;
  width: 400px;
  height: 440px;
  margin: 10px 30px 20px 50px;
  color: #fff;
  padding: 25px 10px 30px 20px;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 22px;
  border-color: #113152;
}
Slack your answer
Remember: the margin and padding values are clockwise (top, right, bottom, left)
Remember: the border values apply to all 4 sides

when you make an element position:relative you make it relative to where it should've been
when you have absolute/fixed positions it becomes possible to have two different elements on top of each other
	higher level z indexes rise to the top
display: none -

#### sorting algorithms

- alrogrithms and programming
  - not the same thing, but has much crossover
  - tells you about how your program will work in simple examples
  - all programs are agorithms

- sorting algorithms - contrived example to talk about algorithms

- how to use algoritm knowledge to get a good job
  - proves you:
    - can deal with abstraction
    - are good with logical constructs
    - have higer level understanding of programming complexity

- what is sorting?
  - what data structures does it operate on
  - what do you start with and what do you end up with

- basic sorting algo implementation

- how to measure efficiency in your programs
  - big O
  - time complexity
  - space complexity

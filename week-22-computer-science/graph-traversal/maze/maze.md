### Graph representation of a Maze and Graph Traversal

#### Objectives:
**after this lesson students will be able to:**
- construct a directed acyclical graph using the adjacency list data structure
- traverse a graph using for and while loops
- find a value in a graph using the Breadth First Search alogirthm
- construct a path to a given value in a graph

#### Introduction 10-15 mins
- explain what a graph is and terminology

#### Students do: 15 mins (paired exercise)
- think about what different ways we can represent nodes and paths

#### Teacher Do 5 mins [20mins in]
- explain the three canonical data structures used to represent graphs
- incorporate student answers if possible
- tanslate into working javascript code

#### Teacher Do 5 mins [25mins in]

- introduce d3 visualization
- use js code you just wrote

#### Students Do 10 mins (paired exercise) [30mins in]

- have students work with the d3 example code, entering their own graphs

#### Teacher Do 15-20 mins [50mins in]

- explain why graphs are useful, problem domains
- explain graph traversal algorithms
- introduce BFS
  - guide students step by stem through the algorithm pseudo code
  - use different visualizations to show whats happening
  - deomnstrate it using the d3 example code

#### Students Do 15 mins (paired exercise) [1hr 5mins in]
- pair students by level of understanding- pair students who understand less with students who understand more
- ask students to step through each step of the alogrithm pseudo code, writing down current values at each step

#### Teacher Do 15 mins [1hr 20mins in]
- talk about implementation specifics of the algorithm in javascript
- what data structures do we use and what control structures

#### Students do 30 mins ( same pairs ) [1hr 50mins in]
- have students implement a loop that visits each node in a graph (BFS traversal)

#### Teacher Do 10 mins [2hr in]
- talk about a maze as represented by a graph
- talk about how to find your way through a graph
- deomstrate with demo code
- reintroduce the alogorithm and talk about the next step to implement
- introduce students to maze demo code
- implement the condition of finding the thing

#### Students Do 30 mins ( same pairs ) [2hr 30mins in]
- students implement found condition

#### Teacher Do 10 mins [2hr 40mins in]
- reintroduce the alogorithm and talk about the next step to implement
- implement the condition of finding the thing

#### Students Do 20 mins [3hr in]
- students implement path generation

#### Teacher Do 10 mins [3hr 10mins in]
- conclusion, talk about next day

I like that you reset the timer for each question. That's a cool take on the assignment.

I would add two things:
1. The correct answers for the problems that the player got wrong
2. A countdown of the number of questions left to answer

I like that you experimented with timer.js, but timers aren't that hard to make on your own. Why'd you go this route? I don't think it's a bad choice. It's actually pretty impressive that you found an external source that works, AND got it working.

Great job overall. You're a boss.

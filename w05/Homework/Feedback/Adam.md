Great start so far!

In your index.html file, what is line 63 doing?

make your console.log() statements more descriptive so that you can follow along to see where the code breaks. So instead of writing console.log("this works"), I would write console.log("#sc click event working") so that you know that that chunk of code is functioning.

The CSS of your game is off so I'm not sure where the user enters their answer. Where is that section?

You're missing a compare function to compare the users input to the correct answer. Pseudocode that and send me what you have so we can discuss it.

When hover over the letter, the cursor should change to a hand or an arrow. Just a small UI pet peeve of mine.

The 30-second countdown isn't working. Let me know if you need help with it. The solution that Ahmed made has a good approach. 

One way to improve your code would be to dynamically create the <p> tags for the answer choices and randomize their order. That way you can loop through the click event for each set of answers, instead of making a click function for each answer. Try pseudocoding it if you're interested and send it to me. 

Overall, great job.

lesson-plan-5.2.md

This is for the first extra help day in week 5 

Students have went through the lessons for:
HTML, CSS, GIT, Heroku, JS, jQuery

Students have not went through the lessons for:
AJAX, Firebase, Constructors, Prototype, Node.

To do: 

- this needs to become modular and 

- in the format of our previous lesson plans.

- instructors and TAs need to group the class based on how they feel the students are doing



Stacey the Renaissance Woman:

"This is a chance for students to review stuff they’re feeling uncomfortable with and spend time getting caught up. We won’t be providing a formal lesson plan because you know best what people are struggling with - but if you need any help with what to go over or how to structure the class, please reach out to myself or Pavan.

I’d suggest that the T/Th group check with Ahmed after tonight’s class and see what ended up being the most helpful.

A few ideas of how you can use tonight’s class: 
- recycle some old class exercises 
- review the homework for this week and next 
- give the floor to students to ask questions 
- start with a poll everywhere vote and see which topics are the trickiest and then go back and cover those

As much as possible, let’s make this interactive so that students are talking to eachother - you can also get people in groups to talk about what is most difficult and leverage the stronger students to help the weaker students with problem issues

Maybe even look at who did the best on homework and have them lead a group through the last homework?

Big focus should be less on lecture and more on having students practice stuff, fail and get the help they need."





Ahmed The Legend:

"Right now here's my gameplan:

1) I'm going to breeze through the things I think have been key in class

2) Along the way we are going to have students come up and demo small bits of code like for loops and arrays and bootstrap layouts

3) Once we're done with that I'm going to divide the group into pre-defined groups (strong and weak). And say if you feel comfortable with everything -- then your task for the rest of the day is to come up with your own creation. It can be a website or JS application.

4) If there are things that were fuzzy from today or in past homework -- then we are going to focus on that.

Most important about this though is that groups need to be pre-defined... If you have a mix of strong and weak, then strong will make everyone say: "Yeah. We get it"...."

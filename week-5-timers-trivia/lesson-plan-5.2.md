# Have you read the Instructor Guide?

You should before you teach anyone anything.

Have a question? It's probably in the Instructor Guide.

Look at this file at the root of the repository:
[Instructor Guide](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/All-Lesson-Plans/blob/master/instructor_guide)

# Master Objectives (Internal Use - do not share with students - because it's a waste of time)

* Build student confidence and mastery of concepts covered so far.
* Provide students with an extended opportunity for supported  coding.
* Allow students to re-work on critical assignments (exercises and homework) covered in class.

# Theme: Catching Up!

# Objectives (Slack out to students, have unique students read each one and Instructor makes a comment after each one is read)

* Provide students an opportunity to ask conceptual questions regarding any of the subjects covered so far (HTML, CSS, Git, Javascript, jQuery, etc.)
* Provide students with a high-level listing of the most important subjects covered to date.
* Provide students with an opportunity for group coding of previous or new projects. 

### 1. Instructor do (5 minutes)
* *Explain to class that today will be focused on providing an opportunity for review and recallibration. The class will be divided into three parts. 1) A few moments to answer lingering questions, 2) A high-level overview of all the major topics covered, 3) And two hours of coding in small groups either redoing select assignments or working on a new project.*

### 2. Instructor do (10-15 minutes)

* *Using Poll Everywhere or a similar anonymous method have students provide open feedback regarding the general subjects or concepts they feel most hazy about. Be sure to provide adequate time for all students to provide feedback*

* *Then, offer brief (VERY BRIEF) commentary on the subjects.*

* *Open the floor to specific questions tied to these subjects*

### 3. Instructor do (5 minutes)

* *Divide the class into pre-defined groups based on personalities and general mastery of the subject so far. Be sure to pair strong students with strong students and weaker students with weaker ones. If possible, this should be done PRIOR to class.*

* *Have students switch seats and then join their defined groups* 
 

### 4. Instructor do (20 minutes)

* *Using the slides provided as a guide, quickly list and explain (at a high-level) the key takeaways students should feel comfortable with at this point in the class. Encourage the class to take note of any topics that remain difficult and to write them down as you speak.*

* *Be sure to ask individual students questions from time to time to maintain engagement!* 

* *After discussing each section, give the groups a moment to talk to one another and confirm that they understand the topics presented. If there are any issues, encourage them to raise the questions to one another -- and if no member of the team can can answer, to then raise it to the class.* 

* *Continue with this until all topics have been covered. Just aim to have at least 2 hours of class time left by the time this recap is complete. *  

### 5. Instructor do (5 minutes)

* *Task the student groups with choosing one of 5 different group assignments to work on for the remaider of class. They should decide (as a group) which activity(s) to choose based on the following paradigm.*  

```
Review an Activity (Majority of Students)

Can you and your team, comfortably build the Hangman Game (HW 3) from scratch?
No? Then start with Hangman


Can you and your team conceptually explain  how “Ahmed The Game” works?
No? Then start by dissecting Ahmed the Game.


Can you and your team comfortably use jQuery to modify HTML based on clicks?
No? Then start with Lottery Generator. 


Can you and your team comfortably create a grid-based design with Twitter Bootstrap?
No? Then start with Twitter Bootstrap Assignment.
```

* *If a group feels confident with each of the above, task them with the following activity instead. TAs and Instructors should focus attention on weaker groups primarily.*

```
Come up with your own Activity! (Advanced Students)

The activity must involve creating a deliverable and uploading it to heroku.
The final product could be a website design , interactive application (JS), a game, etc.
Be sure to choose something that each member is interested in.
While working on this assignment, make sure to create a single GitHub repository and to submit code changes using pull requests from each collaborator. 
```

### 5. Break (15 minutes)
### 6. Students Do (Groups) (2 hours)
* *Students begin coding. Be sure to encourage them to try coding from scratch if possible. TAs and Instructors should use this time to assist students where needed.*

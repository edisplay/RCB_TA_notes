#Week of 11 homework for Node.js

### Introduction

* You will make Hangman Game.

* Building it with Constructor functions.

* It will be a command line node app that takes in prompted text an input.

* see demonstration of how it works *

* We will build this game step by setup one piece at a time.

## Part 1: Letter

* create a file
```
letter.js
```

* Start by creating a constructor function 
	* named `Letter`
	* it should take an input `let`
	* this constructor should have a property called `charac` which will store the input `let`
	* this constructor should have a property called `appear` set to False
	* create a contructor function called `letterRender`
	when the function is called, it will check the value of `charac`
	if False return string "_" else it will return `charac`

export the Letter contructor function with `module.exports`

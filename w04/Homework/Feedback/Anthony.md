Siiiiick. Great job! 

You're the silent killer of the class. You've caught way up and are ahead of the pack.

Way to load the js file at the bottom of your htm file! Awesome job.
Your game.js file is structured perfectly. you are such a boss!

Now that you've got the process down, look at the similarities between the click events for each of the crystals. It's possible to make refactor the code to make it more D.R.Y. If each click event function has the same steps, how can you write this code so that there's less code? Hint: (for loops). When you have time, use a for loop to create "savedNum" 1 through 4 for each crystal. You could go even farther and create another for loop so that the same thing happens when you click on each button.

You got this. Great job.

Awesome job overall! Your code is really elegant and easy to read. Your future co-workers are going to love you.

A few things:
1. Look at your file structure. Rename the "homework4" folder to make it more syntactically correct.
2. Now that you've got the process down, look at the similarities between the click events for each of the crystals. It's possible to make refactor the code to make it more D.R.Y. If each click event function has the same steps, how can you write this code so that there's less code? Hint: (for loops). 
When you have time, use a for loop to 
	1. generate a random number for each crystal and 
	2. name the variable associated with that random number. 
You could go even farther and create another for loop so that the same thing happens when you click on each button.

And great use of bootstrap. Way to make the page responsive.

Your code is well-structured but difficult to read/navigate because it's poorly indented. Indent one space to indicate nested elements/functions/etc. I included a doc called AlsGame.js that has your code properly indented. Styling in your js files is NOT arbitrary. Properly indent your code and use semi-colons to make it easy to read. Without "grammar", it's difficult to understand what your intentions are and it's hard to find issues with your code.

Otherwise, this is great. I like your take on the assignment. 

If you get around to refactoring your code, look at the similarities between the click events (tyson, ali, george, frazier). It's possible to make refactor the code to make it more D.R.Y. If each click event function has the same steps, how can you write this code so that there's less code?

Great job overall. You've caught up and are ahead of the pack. I'm proud of you. 

Way to load the js file at the bottom of your htm file! Awesome job.
Your game.js file is structured perfectly. you are such a boss!

A few questions:
1. What is the script tag on line 56 of your index.html file?
2. What is the index_files folder? 
3. In your gemClick function, why do you call the winsLosses function at the end of every click function? Do you need it?

Also, remember to include a document.ready function in your js file (when it's necessary). It ensures that your page will load with the necessary content as soon as the user goes to the page.

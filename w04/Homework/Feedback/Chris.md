This is great! I like your take on the assignment. 

And great use of bootstrap. Way to make the page responsive.

Start putting your js in a different file. You can put it in the game.js file that's in the assets/javascript folder. In your html file, you could add a script tag at the end of the file, just before the closing </body> tag. It would look like this: <script src='javascript/game.js'></script>

Your code is well-structured but difficult to read/navigate because it's poorly indented. Indent one space to indicate nested elements/functions/etc. Styling in your js files is NOT arbitrary. Properly indent your code and use semi-colons to make it easy to read. Without "grammar", it's difficult to understand what your intentions are and it's hard to find issues with your code. You have a hanging

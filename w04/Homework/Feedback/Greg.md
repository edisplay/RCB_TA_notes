Awesome job. I love the video addition. If you're ever looking for work to do, try adding an AJAX call so that a different video plays every time the game is reset. 

One thing I would do is put the body of your html code into a div="container" so that you can make the code responsive. 

If I had to critique one thing about your code it would be the click events for each of the 4 crystals. To make it more dry, I would use a four loop, because the click function is doing the same exact thing for each of the crystals. 

Otherwise, this is great!

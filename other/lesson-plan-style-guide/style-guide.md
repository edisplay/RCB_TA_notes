First thing you want is a 10 to 15 minute partners do exercise going over previous concepts or concepts that will introduce the students to the material.

Everything in the lesson should help the students accomplish the hw - there should be no extra fluff that the students don't use in the hw. This will ensure that there is no waste.

The style of the lesson plan is:
		1. teach a little (15 minutes max)

		2. in between teaching - get them to talk to each other and explain concepts. Make sure they know that they are responsible for the understanding of the people around them.

		If you understand what's going on and the person next to you doesn't, you fail.

		3. after they discuss things call on a student to go over it - get the class to clap for them if they get it right - if wrong say that's ok - move on to someone else

		4. get them to do an exercise

		5. go over the exercise

		6. repeat steps 1-5

# Lesson Plan Goal
* Goals of lesson plan: 
	* To make sure EVERY STUDENT can do the hw by the end of Saturday
	* Get every single person involved at the sametime for the majority of class! 

* Instructor should be talking the least among everyone.

* Instructor's job is to steer the coding and discussion in the right direction by using this lesson plan. Please do not deviate from it. 

* Use your own style when direction isn't provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* example: Relate your experiences to coding for scalabliity

* Weekday Lessons
	* 3 hour class - 15 minute break = 180 minutes - 15 = 165 minutes of class time.
		* 100+ minutes of "Partners do" and "Student do"
* Saturdays
	* 4 hour class - 40 minute break = 240 - 40 = 200 minutes of class time.
		* 120+ minutes of "Partners do" and "Student do"

I think some classes could use a bunch of exercises where the class gets split up into small groups with leaders. The solutions would be provided to the group leaders.

Then the instructor and a TA can all out a student at a time and have a 10 minute one on one with the students. We could get through most of the people.

We could temporarily have a google form that the instructors submit the one on one notes to.

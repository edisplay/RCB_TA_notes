Great job overall! Your objects are awesome! You're well on your way to having object-oriented code.

Don't forget to add the script tag for your javascript code in your .html file. It should be at the bottom of the html file (so that it loads last, after your html and css have loaded) and should look like this:
<script type="text/javascript" href="hangman.js"></script>

make a hangman.js file and put all of your javascript in there.

Now that you've got the basic functionality, work on two things: 
1. adding spaces (instead of hyphens) in words. I can send you a hint when you get stuck.
2. show a picture of the movie when the player guesses the word correctly. We went over a problem in class where you had to use jQuery to reveal 8 divs in the browser to spell the word "perfect". Use that example as a reference.

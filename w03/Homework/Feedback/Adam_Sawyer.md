Nice work on the keystroke function. 

Clean up your files. your javascript should be in your games.js file, not in the index2.html file. Also, get rid of the index.html file; it's a duplicate.

what happens when you win? Display something. Right now, you're only displaying something when the user loses. 

Look over your code. Right now, a user is able to guess a letter when guessesLeft = 0. They shouldn't be able to. Add that condition to your code. In other words, what happens when guessesLeft = 0?

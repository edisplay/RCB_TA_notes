Great start, Brian. Your code is well-structured.

A few thoughts:
you have the wrong jquery link in your html file. you should add it to your head tag like this:
<script src="jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script>
It's possible that that's why nothing is loading.

In the future, if your code isn't running, stop coding. Are you writing a few words of code, saving, and refreshing the browser to make sure it's working? When did your code stop running?

Let's chat next week about catching you up and going over the structure of the assignments.

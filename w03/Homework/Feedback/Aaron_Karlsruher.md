Awesome job!

wins and losses and guesses left are incrementing/decrementing properly. Your .js file is nicely structured with all variables declared at the top.

Add pseudocode to your files. You may not think you will, but you'll forget what your code was supposed to do. Having pseudocode will help jog your memory. It'll also be easier to find pieces of code that you can use later in other apps.

Lastly, be careful where you put your window.onload function. Put it at the end of the document. That way, you ensure that all of your files (all of your images, html, etc.) load first before any code runs.

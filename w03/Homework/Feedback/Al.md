Awesome design! And I love the theme.

Watch Ahmed's video tonight. It's really helpful to see how we set up our files. Declare all of your global variables at the top, write your functions in the middle, and write the functionality to run the game at the bottom (this is where you'd call all of your functions and start the game).

Think about what you want to happen when the page loads:
	wins = 0
	losses = 0
	generate a random word
	...etc etc.
All of these steps can go into a function called startGame(){}. You just need to move a few things around to get your game object inside of a startGame function. That should help if getting the game restarted when a player wins/losses.

You owe me $9.25 for missed semi-colons.

Great job overall. That "game" object is boss. You're one of the only people that used objects in their code.

Awesome job on this assignment. Your code is really well-structured and you obviously spent a lot of time planning.

in your compare method, you end with an "if" statement. Try to avoid that; it's not the best form. An "else if" or "else" statement should follow an "if" statement, and you should end on an "else" or "elsif".

Now that you've got this functionality down, add some code that resets everything to 0, after the user has won 3 times.

Great work. Once you add some css to make it pretty, you should add this to your portfolio.

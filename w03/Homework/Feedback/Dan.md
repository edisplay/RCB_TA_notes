Siiiiick. This is very cool. I like that you made it your own and used click events instead of keystrokes. 

Now that you have the basic structure down, instead of hard-coding var winner = "fitzgerald", make an array of words and randomly select one. So var winner = randomWord.

Check out the solutions that Ahmed posted. You could easily integrate one into your app to make it object-oriented. 

Great job, so far.

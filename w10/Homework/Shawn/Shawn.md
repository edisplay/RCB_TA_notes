include your package.json in your git push. It has the critical info I need to run the app. Without it, I have to figure out which modules to install and which file to initiate to run the app.

Nice switch statement. Abstract your code even more by creating four functions and calling them in the switch statement. 

Use prompt module to let the user know what they should type in terminal to see tweets, get song/movie info, etc. 

Otherwise, great job! Your code is super concise and fun to read.

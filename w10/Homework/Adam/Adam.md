This is a great start.

when I run "node liri.js" your app returns everything: the tweets object, and info about "What's my age again". 

To get the tweets, go through the "tweets" object and find the key that will return the value you want. And of course, the value that you want is the actual content of each tweet.

I see you started the switch statement and then abandoned it? What wasn't working? You have the right idea! Keep going. The first case (my-tweets) should work fine. The logic for the "spotify-this-song" case looks a little off, but you have the right idea. What I would do is just call one function for each case. And then within that function (ex. spotifyIt() ) that's where you have your if statements. If the user inputs a song, get info about the song; if they don't input anything, get info about "What's my age again". 

Keep me posted on your progress. You got this.

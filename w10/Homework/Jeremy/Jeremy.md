error accessing twitter account

check out line 108. The syntax of your code is off. The .get method takes 3 parameters - the method ("statuses/user_timeline"), params, and the third is your callback function (you left out the word "function")

badass switch statement you have there. nice work!

great job with the other functions/methods. And I love your pseudocode!

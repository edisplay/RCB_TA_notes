try to avoid spaces in the user prompts. instead of "spotify this song", go for "spotify-this-song".

In addition to prompting for a song/movie name prompt the user for their input from the very beginning. if I wasn't in this class and I wanted to use your app, I wouldn't know what I had to type in after "node liri.js" in order to get tweets, movie or song info, etc. Tell the user what their options are. 

LOVE LOVE LOVE the time log. Nice touch. 

instead of having lots of if statements, use a switch statement to execute specific actions depending on the users input. so one case of the switch statement would be "my tweets" and then you could call a function getTweets() that gets the last 20 tweets (lines 70 through 107). your code would be more concise this way. 

Great job overall and your bonus is sweet. You can easily scale this up to have it post in the browser instead of in txt files. 

B+

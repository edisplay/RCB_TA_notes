you give them a request, they go back to the kitchen and they bring it back to you. like a waiter

in a web app what is a request and what is a response?
request - send something to firebase to get data
response - the data from firebase
simplest request you can make from your own file system? when you request a web page.

node is asynchronous. why is this relevant to servers? code doesn't run in order written.

protocol is way of facilitating communication between servers/browsers

how do we get the command line arguments in node? process.argv[i]

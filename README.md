# All-Lesson-Plans

#### Please don't push to master without making a branch and making a pull request to pavankat!!!!

### Problem? Idea? Suggestion?
* text Pavan Katepalli - 732-236-8447 about anything! 
  + Texting me is the fastest way to get to me since my email gets flooded. 
    + I do however priortize emails from instructors, TAs and lesson planners above everyone else. Your voice is the most important part of the Company.

### Want to contribute?

* Make a branch with your ```<github name>-<lesson you are editing>-<full date>```
  + So pavankat-lesson-one-2-13-22 would be good if it was year 2022 ;)
* Then make a pull request and assign it to pavankat
* Then slack me about it to remind me

# Have you read the Instructor Guide?

You should before you teach anyone anything.

Have a question? It's probably in the Instructor Guide.

look at this file at the root of the repository: 
[Instructor Guide](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/All-Lesson-Plans/blob/master/instructor_guide.md)

### Master Objectives (Internal Use - do not share with students - because it's a waste of time)
* review mySQL topics: basic C.R.U.D
* Create a database structure in a relation for JOINs
* Create a Node app which can perform C.R.U.D with mySQL npm

### Objectives (Slack out to students, have unique students read each one and Instructor makes a comment after each one being read)

Students will be able to:

	* Create database structures relationally and use JOIN on them
	* Start a Node server running mySQL npm connect to locatl mySQL db
	* Perform C.R.U.D using Node on mySQL db

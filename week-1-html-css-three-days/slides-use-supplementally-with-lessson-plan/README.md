The lesson-plan-1.1.md file is enough to use.

You do not need these slides. 

However, you can use these if you please. But, please still follow the script in lesson-plan-1.1.md!!!

The slides are in the class-slides-1.1.pptx file, but also provided in jpg format per slide. 

The slides are for the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. If you want to use these for your University, then you'll have to rebrand these.

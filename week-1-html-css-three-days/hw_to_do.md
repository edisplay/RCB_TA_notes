just talked to Jed about how to prevent students from freaking out during weeks 1+2 in the future.

I'm going to update the homeworks for week 1 and 2 for future cohorts

weeks 1 and 2 will be really easy

part one 7/10

part two 3/10

part twos for 1 and 2  will be what we assigned students for week 1 + 2 in JC feb 16 and NB jan 16. I feel like the majority of students won't do them, but at the sametime, we won't get any drops.

The students that are struggling, for the most part didn't do their pre work at all. Eric Lopez didn't have any of the programs installed and didnt even have access to install programs on his computer. Moving forward, I'm thinking that's going to happen at least to 5 to 8 people each cohort, so we'll account for that.

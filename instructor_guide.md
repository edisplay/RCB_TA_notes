# Students and Lesson Plans

* don't give lesson plans to students
		* it'll ruin the magic

* have lesson plans open on your phone/tablet so you can refer to it during the class and also have it open on your computer but not visible to students (so you can copy and paste stuff from it to them on slack)

* during class you'll have Sublime Text open on your screen for the most of it while also referring to things on Google.

# Public and Lesson Plans

* never share lesson plans with anyone outside of Trilogy Education Services

# Lesson Plan Goal
* Goal of lesson plan: Get every single person involved at the sametime for the majority of class! 

* Instructor should be talking the least among everyone.

* Instructor's job is to steer the coding and discussion in the right direction by using this lesson plan. Please do not deviate from it. 

* Use your own style when direction isn't provided
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* example: Relate your experiences to coding for scalabliity

* Weekday Lessons
	* 3 hour class - 15 minute break = 180 minutes - 15 = 165 minutes of class time.
		* 100+ minutes of "Partners do" and "Student do"
* Saturdays
	* 4 hour class - 40 minute break = 240 - 40 = 200 minutes of class time.
		* 120+ minutes of "Partners do" and "Student do"

* Does the lesson plan fit into the master learning objectives agreed to by the University?
	* Develop your vision for a website -- and then build it!
	* Expertly navigate the file system and terminal basics
	* Work independently or in a group on complex projects throughout the entire development lifecycle
	* Understand the basics of troubleshooting and enhancing legacy code
	* Communicate the basics of serving a webpage and how the browser renders code
	* Build a frontend website either from scratch or utilizing a frontend framework (such as Bootstrap)
	* Deploy static websites to a cloud provider
	* Create and deploy dynamic websites to a cloud provider utilizing a backend framework
	* Implement complex logical conditions to meet an objective.
	* Write SQL commands to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete commands
	* Utilize an ORM to manage a database schema and connection from a server
	* Create a full-stack Single Page Application with AJAX communication
	* Create and consume RESTful API’s utilizing JSON as a data format
	* Create session based applications utilizing user authentication schemes that are well-known and widely used
	* Understand and implement the mechanics of Git flow (including branching, merging, pull requests)
	* Apply ‘social coding’ accepted and best practices (including source control, issue tracking, functional feedback, etc)
	* Write clean code with proper variable names, indentation according to industry best practices

# Basics

* While students do exercises
	* take a breather
	* walk around make sure they're coding
	* help the students that aren't fully grasping everything

* If you have your microphone working (so Panopto can pick up your voice), then by all means, walk around - be Jaime Escalante from Stand and Deliver.
	
	* [Stand and Deliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_and_Deliver)

* Always mention the theme

* Always slack out the objectives
	* Cold call different students to read them out loud to the class.
	* Comment briefly about each one

* Always slack out the in class exercises
	* have someone read them outloud
	* make sure you explain it before starting the timer

* Always show a timer on the board during exercises (google timer and put your sound up so the alarm will go off)

* During one on ones: GUIDE don't TELL 
	* unless it's work flow errors (bad indentations, no word wrap, doesn't have console open)

	* unless you're in a time crunch. Go ahead tell, but use check points.

# Key for Instructors/TAs

* Partners do = Students work with a partner
	* partners pair program 
		* one person types
		* other person is main driver
		* typer drives too but less
		* make sure they alternate after each "Partners do" exercise

			* option 1: Match partners by like ability: 

				"Raise your hands if you feel good about event handlers." 

				Then call off the names of people with raised hands to pair off with each other, and ask them to come up to the class. 

				"Raise your hands if you feel decent about event handlers." 

				Then call off the names of people with raised hands to pair off with each other, and ask them to come to the back of the class. 

				* Then call off the people remaining one by one to be paired.

			* option 2: Match partners strong to weak: 

				"Raise your hands if you feel good about event handlers." 

				Then call on someone who has their hand raised and then someone who doesn't - they're partners.

				- you have to be careful - some personalities don't fit. Use your judgement. 

* Student do = Students work individually 
	* ask the students to slack you the code after they're done. This will let you see who is struggling and who isn't.

	* Have slack on your phone to give feedback to students during a tim you're free (a future exercise)

* Everyone do = Instructor does something and students do it along

* Instructor do = Instructor types, no one should be typing
	* Instructor: "I'm going to do something now, I need everyone to close their laptops. No need for them now. This code will be provided to you after so don't worry about taking notes either"

* Cold call = call on someone
	* avoid doing this often because it engages only one person in the class and not everyone
	
	* you want to strategically do this at times so that you can get your star students to answer questions. 
		* be sure the same student isn't answering every cold call 
			* kind of a downer for other students

	* How to raise someone's confidence
		* Sometimes, you'll find yourself with a below average student right before you're supposed to do a cold call. Give them large clues to the answer.

		* Call on them. 
		* Compliment them. 
		* Make the class clap.

* Check points = Questions you ask the student(s) to make sure they understand what's going on
	* Bad check point: "Do you understand?"
	* Good check point: "So in your own words, what does this line of code do?"

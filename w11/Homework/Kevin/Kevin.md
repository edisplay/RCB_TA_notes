Awesome code! You're such a boss. 

That studentPrompt object is pretty sweet.

why do you use const instead of var? As long as you know the difference, it's cool with me? Sometimes it's counterproductive to use it. Check this out:

What's a valid input for the grade. Prompt the user so they don't get stuck here. It should be a letter instead of a number; GPA is a number.

why is caught sleeping in class a #? should be true or false. if it's the number of times they've been caught sleeping in class, make that clearer in the prompt.

How do I get out of this thing? I don't want to have to keep adding students.

Kick students off the bus! (Do the bonus.) You got this!

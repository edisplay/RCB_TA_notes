check out line 21 in main.js. I think you used the wrong name for the function.

You need to give yourself more credit. I know that not finishing the assignment is frustrating and defeating, BUT you understand more than you think you do.

Your main.js file is structured as it should be. The only method that should be in there is the busChatter function (and there weren't many people who got that far). 

When we meet we can go through the bus.js file and clean things up. 

Great start. When I commented out lines 21 & 23 in main.js, the program ran smoothly. We just need to add a few things.

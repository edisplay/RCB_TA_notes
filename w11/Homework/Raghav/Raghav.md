This is a great start. I'm going to suggest you look at Wojciech or Greg's code for pointers.

Overall, you're getting the hang of this. I'm happy to see you got the syntax for the student and bus constructors down. Keep working on this. You're pretty close.

Also, don't forget to require files when you need them. Looks like you forgot to require the bus.js file in your main.js file.

Lastly, move the prompt functions to the main.js file. The homework instructions tell you exactly where to put what. You want to keep the files as separate as you can - so if the code doesn't pertain specifically to creating the student, put it somewhere else. The only code that should be in the student.js file is the code for the Student constructor.

server can read and send a file
can give other files types like images
in addition to sending files, can initiate a process, can convert things. in general, can do things in response to a request

LIRI example:
we used a server to do an AJAX/GET request to twitter
part of the challenge in the HW assignments, wasn't getting the tweets. the real challenge was in parsing the JSON. we've done it before, but always from perspective of the front-end - used browser and used chrome extension to neatly display it.

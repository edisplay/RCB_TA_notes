1. Class Day (70-90 min)

---> Create a node application which takes in a URL - performs a GET request then writes the JSON to an HTML file.
	output for this: instead of printing the JSON to console, copy/paste to an html file and then load the html file in the browser. 
	figure out how to do a GET request using Node.

-- > Then immediately launches your browser to that page.
	basically, figure out how to write the file with the array so that it looks like a JSON in a browser

-- > Code must be separated out into separate files. I.e. code for launching the page should be in a separate file from the code for running the ajax. You should be using ajax.

--> Hint:

    1. You will need to get the URL (will you use prompt? Will you use an argument?)

    2. You will need to figure out how to dump the data to an HTML file in a format that is readable

        --> I want the JSON to be formatted well. As in, it should be something like this.

    3. You will need to figure out how to "launch" the page in node.

    Bonus:
    1. Create a separate file called `log.html`. This file should log every single HTTP request sent to it. with a timestamp.
		this is conceptually building a server
    Ex:
    3-15-16 | www.google.com/finance
    3-17-16 | www.nyt.com/pickles

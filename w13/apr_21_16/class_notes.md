what's a web server? it handles requests for information and serves them back to the requester

when you run a server on your machine, your machine is referred to as localhost. however, if we're all on the same network and if the firewall allows for it, then someone could get to your server using your IP address

http generally runs on port 80 (or 443 if it's secure).

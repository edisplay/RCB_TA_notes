# Style Guide (need to finish asap)

Follow this style so every instructor and TA are all consistent across the board nationally. 

Holly:
```
noticed quite a few problems; div soup, not using <nav> tags for what's clearly a nav, there's a style dir with images inside (how is images a style?), using <section> tags where they should be <article>'s, <div>'s where there should be <section>'s, some forms have <label>'s whereas others don't, <div> where it should be <p>, and on and on.
```

<!-- the basic structure of your HTML file is ALWAYS: -->
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- tells the browser the type of file to look for. you do not have to close this tag -->
<html> <!-- everything goes inside these tags. don't forget to close this tag at the end of the document -->
  <head>  <!-- the tags that live inside this (head) tag do not actually appear on the page but they are still VERY important.  -->
      <title>Profile of Brian Martinez</title> <!-- whatever you put inside your title tag will show up in the browser on the tab -->
    <link> <!-- link to your css files. inside of href, you write the folders and files from the perspective of the index.html file. so your index.html file is in a folder called HOMEWORK and your css files are in a folder within the HOMEWORK folder called CSS, your link tag would look like this:  -->
    <link rel="stylesheet href="css/style.css>     
    <!-- you must provide a link to every css and html file that is a part of your site  -->
  </head>
<body>
  <!-- EVERYTHING ELSE. whatever you put in here will show up in the browser -->
</body>
</html>

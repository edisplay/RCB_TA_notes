internal apps idea

- for assessments - when instructor gives it out - instructor opens the link and has a close submissions button

and it'll close the submissions

hangouts or some other video conferencing software that lets us break out into groups or break into partner work remotely

	I'd love a class 'health check'

	[8:55] 
	Log in, enter cohort

	[8:55] 
	See stats

	[8:55] 
	Diagnose issues

	[8:55] 
	Etc

	pavankat [8:58 AM] 
	love it :simple_smile:

	[8:58] 
	that instructor report card

	[8:58] 
	we're going to turn it into a google form

	[8:58] 
	and give it to all TAs

	[8:58] 
	to handle

	[8:58] 
	so we can get report cards about all the instructors

	[8:58] 
	so we'll know about teachers

	[8:58] 
	students

	[8:59] 
	overall stats

	[9:06] 
	Can u imagine when we ask about how a student is doing and instead of saying 'ok' we can pull every eval, homework assignment, attendance, hiring pad score. And it builds to a master score?


	[9:06] 
	we can correctly diagnose students quick

	[9:07] 
	and help them immediately

	[9:07] 
	it would help student success tremendously

	Same for instructors. A leaderboard of how many times they get students to participate. Way pay per positive interaction


------

x is on top - he has a 30. Here r the drivers. His students index 20% higher than average

[9:08] 
Based on the scorecard

[9:09] 
Maybe we can start with 3 data points for students and thee for instructors

	9:09] 
Students: eval, hw, attendance

[9:10] 
Instructor: evals, interactions, student scores on evals

eventually throw in pre work and the profile that admissions do

[9:11] 
and we'll have a complete picture of which students succeed

[9:11] 
and which ones don't

Yes. This is an operating system for effective competency based education

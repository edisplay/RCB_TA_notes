look at this file at the root of the repository:

# Objectives (Slack out to students, have unique students read each one and Instructor makes a comment after each one being read)

1. slack out the objectives to the students, and call on random students to read them outloud. *Make a comment about each objective after a person reads it.*

1. in class repo for your section, make a new folder for this week and day.

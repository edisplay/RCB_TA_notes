# Week 2 Assignment

### Objectives
* Make the standard portfolio site you coded last week responsive
* Create a unique and sophisticated portfolio using Bootstrap

### Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.

### Week 2 Mantra

Week 1 you learned a lot of html/css, github and heroku
Week 2 you'll learn an easier way to manage the html/css along with some more github stuff
Week 3 we'll start JavaScript, and weeks 1+2 get used a lot less

There is no need to panic over week 1's material. Because you'll have 23 weeks to digest it and get good at it. 

Again, Week 1 doesn't build over the next 23 weeks. Stay calm. You'll have plenty of time to get better at it.


### Assignment One Instructions
1. Inside your `portfolio` folder, find the `style.css` file. At the bottom you will write your media queries.
  + Use three `@media screen` tags with a `max-width` of `980px`, `768px`, and `640px`.
    + You use `980px` because you never want any of the content to be cut off. Since the desktop layout is about 960px wide, you want the media queries to kick in before it cuts off the content.
    `768px` is about the width of a tablet and `640px` is about the width of a phone in landscape
2. Make the layout match the following screenshots:
  + `index.html` - [980px](homework_assets/980-index.jpg), [768px](homework_assets/768-index.jpg), [640px](homework_assets/640-index.jpg)
  + `portfolio.html` - [980px](homework_assets/980-portfolio.jpg), [768px](homework_assets/768-portfolio.jpg), [640px](homework_assets/640-portfolio.jpg)
  + `contact.html` - [980px](homework_assets/980-contact.jpg), [768px](homework_assets/768-contact.jpg), [640px](homework_assets/640-contact.jpg)
3. Make the position of the header `static` (the default positioning) when the screen is `640px` wide. You want to do this because the header design takes up a lot of room which is undesirable on small screens.
4. Be sure to include the `viewport` tag in all your html files.
5. *Pro-tip: Use the Chrome extensions [Window Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh) and [Browser Width](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-width/mlnegepkjlccabakompdmbcmdieaideh) to see the browser dimensions in Chrome.*

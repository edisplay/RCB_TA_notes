# Engagement Tactics (most important part)

### Checkpoints
- You should do check points. "Everyone explain what the css on the board does. Go you have three minutes!" ... "Stop! Ok, Allison what does the code on the screen do?" If she gets it wrong then ask the person next to her. If that person gets it right then tell them that they need to up their game and start explaining things better to the people around them.

### Don't ask - TELL!

During in class exercises, you should be checking every single person's computer screen. 

DO NOT ASK INDIVIDUALS IF THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO! Command them to show you their code. Then point them in the right direction. 

- Make sure 1 of your TAs who is not giving feedback on homework is doing the same.

You will say:
> You are in a team atmosphere, help your neighbor, let's make everyone a strong developer so your group projects will be stronger. If your neighbor fails, you fail.

You'll be able to tell if they don't understand by SEEING THEIR CODE. Not by asking them if they understand.

### Forcing Questions

I will not continue until someone asks me a good question

Often, during a confusing concept, students won't ask questions even though they should. 

* force a question out

> I will not continue teaching until I get one good question about this.

* *make sure the question is good before continuing*

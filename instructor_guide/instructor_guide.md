# Pavan to do get academic sop in here and links to videos

When teaching in front of the class: make sure the students can all do the hw by the end of the week. Teach enough to do so. The lesson plans are built to do this, but now 

What do you do in class?

1. teach a little (15 minutes max)

2. in between teaching - get them to talk to each other and explain concepts. Make sure they know that they are responsible for the people around them.

If you understand what's going on and the person next to you doesn't, you fail.

3. after they discuss things call on a student to go over it - get the class to clap for them if they get it right - if wrong say that's ok - move on to someone else

4. get them to do an exercise

5. go over the exercise

6. repeat steps 1-5

Students are liars

"do you understand" "yeah i got this"

meanwhile they don't even have sublime text installed.

look at their screen and then help them get to the conclusions they have to get to.





# Preparing for class
* have lesson plans open on your phone/tablet so you can refer to it during the class and also have it open on your computer but not visible to students (so you can copy and paste stuff from it to them on slack)

* during class you'll have Sublime Text open on your screen for the most of it while also referring to things on Google.

Before class, during prep time, set up your in class repos like I did here for day one: https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/0201-mw-class-content/tree/master/week1-html-css-terminal-git-heroku

- MANY OF YOU ASKED ME THIS: how should I deal with constantly going to the lesson plan to copy and paste exercises to the students? The answer is prepping and doing step 4 above!!!

- When I did step 4 today, it made teaching class today for me cake. 

I felt a lot more relaxed than I usually did because I eliminated the need to constantly jump between the lesson plan and my in class code. 

I didn't have to constantly copy and paste things from the lesson plan. Because it was all ready for me! 

# why you can't fall behind

if you fall behind, the students fall behind.

if the students fall behind - they can't do the hw. And if they can't do the hw - then that pushes everything. And there's no room for error, because the career curriculum coincides with certain parts of the actual curriculum, and we have a limited amount of days to make sure that these students learn everything and become developers.

# during student/partner exercises
1. go to google and search timer
2. set it to the time allowed
3. put your volume up
4. After you set the timer, make sure it's up on the board clear so everyone can see, so students didn't know how much time was left
5. Throughout the time period, you should give students updates regarding how long they have left for exercises.

# always do checks for understanding



# Students and Lesson Plans

* don't give lesson plans to students
		* it'll ruin the magic

# Public and Lesson Plans

* never share lesson plans with anyone outside of Trilogy Education Services

# Your Computer Turns Off

* Buy yourself time

1. "<TA name> is going to slack out the code to the exercise I just went over to everyone. I want you all to spend the next 10 minutes explaining it to each other. I'm going to call on random people at the end. The explanations better be perfect, and if you're wrong, I'm holding you, AND the people around you accountable."

2. "solve project euler problem 5, <TA name> will send you all a link on Slack. You have 20 minutes."

# The Projector Stops Working

* Improvise

1. Start a Join.me session. Share your screen, have everyone mute their microphones. Share the link to the class.

2. Above ^^ with Google Hangout. Have everyone mute and hide their webcam.

# How to send exercises out to students

* leverage TAs to send out exercises to students on slack

* do it yourself, copy the exercise part of a lesson plan and slack it out to the students

# Basics

* While students do exercises
	* take a breather
	* walk around make sure they're coding
	* help the students that aren't fully grasping everything

* If you have your microphone working (so Panopto can pick up your voice), then by all means, walk around - be Jaime Escalante from Stand and Deliver.
	
	* [Stand and Deliver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_and_Deliver)

* Always mention the theme

* Always slack out the objectives
	* Cold call different students to read them out loud to the class.
	* Comment briefly about each one

* Always slack out the in class exercises
	* have someone read them outloud
	* make sure you explain it before starting the timer

* Always show a timer on the board during exercises (google timer and put your sound up so the alarm will go off)

* During one on ones: GUIDE don't TELL 
	* unless it's work flow errors (bad indentations, no word wrap, doesn't have console open)

	* unless you're in a time crunch. Go ahead tell, but use check points.

# Lesson Plan Key for Instructors/TAs

* Partners do = Students work with a partner
	* partners pair program 
		* one person types
		* other person is main driver
		* typer drives too but less
		* make sure they alternate after each "Partners do" exercise

			* option 1: Match partners by like ability: 

				"Raise your hands if you feel good about event handlers." 

				Then call off the names of people with raised hands to pair off with each other, and ask them to come up to the class. 

				"Raise your hands if you feel decent about event handlers." 

				Then call off the names of people with raised hands to pair off with each other, and ask them to come to the back of the class. 

				* Then call off the people remaining one by one to be paired.

			* option 2: Match partners strong to weak: 

				"Raise your hands if you feel good about event handlers." 

				Then call on someone who has their hand raised and then someone who doesn't - they're partners.

				- you have to be careful - some personalities don't fit. Use your judgement. 

* Student do = Students work individually 
	* ask the students to slack you the code after they're done. This will let you see who is struggling and who isn't.

	* Have slack on your phone to give feedback to students during a tim you're free (a future exercise)

* Everyone do = Instructor does something and students do it along

* Instructor do = Instructor types, no one should be typing
	* Instructor: "I'm going to do something now, I need everyone to close their laptops. No need for them now. This code will be provided to you after so don't worry about taking notes either"

* Cold call = call on someone
	* avoid doing this often because it engages only one person in the class and not everyone
	
	* you want to strategically do this at times so that you can get your star students to answer questions. 
		* be sure the same student isn't answering every cold call 
			* kind of a downer for other students

	* How to raise someone's confidence
		* Sometimes, you'll find yourself with a below average student right before you're supposed to do a cold call. Give them large clues to the answer.

		* Call on them. 
		* Compliment them. 
		* Make the class clap.

* Check points = Questions you ask the student(s) to make sure they understand what's going on
	* Bad check point: "Do you understand?"
	* Good check point: "So in your own words, what does this line of code do?"

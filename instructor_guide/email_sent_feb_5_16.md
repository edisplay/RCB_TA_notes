Hey All,

This was my first class. There are things I did well. And there are things I could've improved on. 

I want ALL OF YOU to be better than I am! Some of you already are. Some of you aren't. But you all become better teachers than I am, because that's what's going to result from future remote training with us.

My goal is to make all of you elite teachers.

I'd love for you to take a look at the video below:

It starts 1 minute and 20 seconds in:

watch how I 
- command a team atmosphere where success is measured by how well everyone does - not just one person. This atmosphere encourages everyone to help the people around them.
- get students to explain code to each other
- instruct the class to clap for others around them
- bring students up to the class to present
- motivate the students
- repeat things over and over again until the content is drilled into their heads
- watch at how I motivate the students
- make mistakes on purpose to KILL MISCONCEPTIONS BEFORE THEY POISON THE STUDENTS' MINDS
- change the tone and volume of my voice to emphasize certain points and to also awaken the students

THEORY

When teaching in front of the class: make sure the students can all do the hw by the end of the week. Teach enough to do so. The lesson plans are built to do this, but now you're built to do this.

What do you do in class?

1. teach a little (15 minutes max)

2. in between teaching - get them to talk to each other and explain concepts. Make sure they know that they are responsible for the understanding of the people around them.

"If you understand what's going on and the person next to you doesn't, you fail."

3. after they discuss things call on a student to go over it - get the class to clap for them if they get it right - if wrong say that's ok - move on to someone else...

4. get students to do an exercise

5. go over the exercise

6. repeat steps 1-5

STUDENTS ARE LIARS

"do you understand" 

"yeah i got this"

meanwhile the student doesnt even have sublime text installed.

look at their screen and then help them get to the conclusions they need to get to, to finish the exercises and ultimately the homework for the week.

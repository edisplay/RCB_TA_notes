# Style Guide For Trilogy Education Services

### HTML Standards

### CSS Standards

### Pseudo Coding Standards

### JavaScript Standards

* Write functions like this when returning a value

```
var add = function(one, two){
	return one+two;
}
```

* Write functions like this when not returning a value

```
function add(one, two){
	return one + two;
}
```

We should explain to students that they're the same thing. MATTER OF FACT, the second way also creates a variable and adds a reference to that function.

Hey guys, 

Pavan, CLO here.

Can you accept the invite into this slack? https://trilogyed-instruction.slack.com

This slack room will be used for all instructional staff across all universities to stay in contact with one another, share ideas and get support from one another. I suggest, you download the desktop app, and add the slack.

All of you will come up with a brilliant classroom management strategy. 

Do not just share it with your team members. Share your innovations with EVERY instructor across the nation. 

You are part of this team because you're great. Together, we'll become the best there is. 

Let's get connected team!!

For instructor, TAs, please respond saying you will do all 9 of the highlighted steps in this email. If anything is unclear to you, ask me to clarify a certain step.

I came to a realization after I taught class tonight. What's the secret to being a good teacher for Trilogy Education Services?

The mission every week is to make sure that EVERY student can make a big dent in the hw. 

As instructors and TAs, you need to read the hw, see the hw solution and play with the hw solution before the week starts. 

By having this mind set, you can improvise better. You will teach better. You will be able to strategize better.

In the event of running out of time, you'll know what you need to cover, and what not to cover. Because you know the END GAME.

If students can't make a dent in their hw by the end of saturday - then I have failed as CLO. You have failed, and we all fail. 

As instructors and TAs, you are soldiers and your mission is to make sure that every student in the class can do the hw by the end of the week.

That's literally why my lesson planning team does the hw solution first and the lesson plan last. So that every part of the hw is covered in the lessons.

2. As instructors and TAs, you need to read the hw, see the hw solution and play with the hw solution before the week starts. You will all make it your mission to make sure all students are capable of doing the hw by the end of Saturday.  

Everyone who has made a repo on the rutgers coding boot camp channel, Due date for step 3 is February 12th 2016. 

The github page for rutgers coding bootcamp has a lot of repos. The number isn't the issue. It's the disorganization that is the issue. We're going to probably upgrade soon, but we should fix our organization problem first. 

3. Copy your repos to your in class code repo (obviously delete the .git folders otherwise the folder won't be accessible). Then delete the useless repository. Let's clean things up!

relevant commands for git:

Local delete of a branch: git branch --delete <branch name>
Remote delete of a branch: git push origin --delete <branch name>

4. Before class, during prep time, set up your in class repos like I did here for day one: https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/0201-mw-class-content/tree/master/week1-html-css-terminal-git-heroku

- MANY OF YOU ASKED ME THIS: how should I deal with constantly going to the lesson plan to copy and paste exercises to the students? The answer is prepping and doing step 4 above!!!

- When I did step 4 today, it made teaching class today for me cake. 

I felt a lot more relaxed than I usually did because I eliminated the need to constantly jump between the lesson plan and my in class code. 

I didn't have to constantly copy and paste things from the lesson plan. Because it was all ready for me! 

5. All instructors, during class, please code in the in class local repo folder on your computer. 

6. Make sure you push up your code after you're done with class. And share the link with your students!! 

7. If you are going to be late to class, text me (732-236-8447), your TAs, other instructor (if Saturday), your student experience director - SUPER SUPER IMPORTANT YOU DO THIS

8. If you are going to be late to office hours, don't text me, but text your TAs, other instructor (if saturday) and your student experience director. Same goes for TAs

9. all class recordings go here in the format that "class-recordings-ru-piscataway-jan-16.md" is in: https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/All-Classwork-Homework/tree/master/class-recordings 

Make sure you use join.me and make sure that you don't show sensitive information during your classes (to do that, you need to prep before you class and structure your in class repo before class starts)

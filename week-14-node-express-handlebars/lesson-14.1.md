# Have you read the Instructor Guide?

You should before you teach anyone anything.

Have a question? It's probably in the Instructor Guide.

look at this file at the root of the repository: 
[Instructor Guide](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/All-Lesson-Plans/blob/master/instructor_guide.md)

# Master Objectives (Internal Use - do not share with students - because it's a waste of time)
* Expertly navigate the file system and terminal basics
* Work independently or in a group on complex projects throughout the entire development lifecycle
* Implement complex logical conditions to meet an objective.
* Write SQL commands to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete commands
* Write clean code with proper variable names, indentation according to industry best practices

# Objectives (Slack out to students, have unique students read each one and Instructor makes a comment after each one being read)

1. slack out the objectives to the students, and call on random students to read them outloud. *Make a comment about each objective after a person reads it.*

1. in class repo for your section, make a new folder for this week and day.

1. open up that folder in Sublime Text

1. make an objectives.txt file in that folder

1. copy these objectives into that objectives.txt file and save it, commit it, push it up.

* keep the file open while the students are reading the objectives 
  * Students will create an App using Node.js server to connect MySQL database and send data to the page using Express.
  * Students will see why it's difficult to server a web page generated by only using Javascript.
  * Students will practice using handlebar to server pages.

```
ALL or they won't be able to do the homework.
```

PART ONE:
---------

### 1. Student do (20 minutes) 

* *Slack this out and commit this in your in class repo*

* Calculator App exercise:
  - Create an node.js application.
  - Install the Express npm package.
  - Using Express create a server, with one GET route.
  - The route will consist of three parameters, an operation, a number, a second number.
  - Create these four math operations `addition`, `subtraction`, `multiplication`, `division`.
  - When the route is hit, it should display on the page result of the math operation.
  
Example: If my port is 3000, entering the following URL into my browser.

```
http://localhost:3000/addition/10/1
```

The page will display `11`.

BONUS:

* Create a math operation called `fibonacci`.
  * Create the code that will generate the fibonacci numbers.
  * The fibonacci will start with two numbers `[0,1]`
  * The first parameter will check if it's `fibonacci` 
  * The second parameters in the URL will determine how many of the fibonacci numbers you will generate.
  * So if the second parameters is 5 you will generate 5 additional number after the first 2 numbers, displaying 7 numbers total.
  * The third parameters will now change the value of the second number when you generate the fibonacci number.

Example:

```
http://localhost:3000/fibonacci/2/1
```
The page will display: 0,1,1,2

```
http://localhost:3000/fibonacci/10/5
```
The page will display: `0,5,5,10,15,25,40,65,105,170,275,445`

### 2. Everyone do (15 minutes)

* *Go over the previous exercise with the class - call on one unique student per each part of the previous exercise to explain what they did for each part of the exercise*

### 3. Instructor do (15 minutes)
Create a simple Node App to connect to MySQL & Express, that will send data to the page.

* Create app dir named "magical_schools"
* Create Node App `npm init`
* Create `index.js` file
* Install npm package Express `npm install express --save`
* Setup Express in `index.js` file

```
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

var port = 3000;
app.listen(port);
```

* Create a database in MySQL named "wizard_schools_db"
* Create a table named "schools" with the following schema.
* Insert the following data into the table.

```
CREATE DATABASE wizard_schools_db;
USE wizard_schools_db;

CREATE TABLE schools (
id int AUTO_INCREMENT,
name varchar(30) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY(id)
); 

INSERT INTO schools (name) VALUES ("Hogwarts School of Witchcraft");
INSERT INTO schools (name) VALUES ("Castelobruxo");
INSERT INTO schools (name) VALUES ("Durmstrang Institute");
INSERT INTO schools (name) VALUES ("Beauxbatons Academy of Magic");

```

* Install npm package mysql `npm install mysql --save`
* Setup connection to MySQL database in `index.js`

```
var mysql = require('mysql');
var connection = mysql.createConnection({
    port: 8000,
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'root',
    password: '1111',
    database: 'wizard_schools_db'
});

connection.connect(function(err) {
    if (err) {
        console.error('error connecting: ' + err.stack);
        return;
    }
    console.log('connected as id ' + connection.threadId);
});
```

* Setup the Express route with a query from the MySQL database;

```
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM schools', function(err, result) {
      res.send(result);
  });
});
```

### 4. Everyone do (15 minute) 
* *Slack this out and commit this in your in class repo*

Exercise: 
* Given the following data below, create a MySQL databse with a table populating with the given data.


  |id| name  | coolness_points  | attitude |
  |--|-------| ---------- |------|
  |1 |"Jerry"|75|"Relaxed"|
  |2 |"Elaine"|65|"Righteous"|
  |3 |"Kramer"|5|"Doofus"|
  |4 |"George"|25|"Selfish"|


* Create a Node App with Express and MySQL npm.
* Create 3 Express routes:
  * Create a '/cast' route that will display all the names from the table order by `id`
  * Create a '/coolness' route that will display all the coolness_points from the table order from highest value to lowest value
  * Create a '/:attitude' route that will display the name from the table if the param matches attitude to on any row in the table 

### 5. Instructor do (10 minutes) 

* *Go over the previous exercise with the class - call on one unique student per each part of the previous exercise to explain what they did for each part of the exercise*

### 6. Instructor do (5 minutes) 
Instructor shows how you can't send the data from mysql to the page at the sametime 


### 7. Partners do (5 minutes)

> Explain to the people around you what each of these joins do and why they're used. I'll call on random people. If you're wrong, i'm going to call out the people next to you for not explaining it to you well.


-- 15 minute break -- (total including break: 100 minutes)

PART TWO:

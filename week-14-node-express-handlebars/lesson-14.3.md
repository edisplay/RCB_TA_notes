# Have you read the Instructor Guide?

You should before you teach anyone anything.

Have a question? It's probably in the Instructor Guide.

look at this file at the root of the repository: 
[Instructor Guide](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/All-Lesson-Plans/blob/master/instructor_guide.md)

# Master Objectives (Internal Use - do not share with students - because it's a waste of time)


# Objectives (Slack out to students, have unique students read each one and Instructor makes a comment after each one being read)

1. slack out the objectives to the students, and call on random students to read them outloud. *Make a comment about each objective after a person reads it.*

1. in class repo for your section, make a new folder for this week and day.

1. open up that folder in Sublime Text

1. make an objectives.txt file in that folder

1. copy these objectives into that objectives.txt file and save it, commit it, push it up.

1. keep the file open while the students are reading the objectives 

* Students will create a Node App with M.V.C similar to Rails
* Students will create a simple O.R.M for MySQL database
* Students will create a Node Express App with Handlebars and CSS assets

# Theme: 
Node Express Handlebars M.V.C

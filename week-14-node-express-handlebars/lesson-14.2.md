look at this file at the root of the repository: 
[Instructor Guide](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/All-Lesson-Plans/blob/master/instructor_guide.md)

# Master Objectives (Internal Use - do not share with students - because it's a waste of time)
* Expertly navigate the file system and terminal basics
* Work independently or in a group on complex projects throughout the entire development lifecycle
* Implement complex logical conditions to meet an objective.
* Write SQL commands to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete commands
* Write clean code with proper variable names, indentation according to industry best practices

# Objectives (Slack out to students, have unique students read each one and Instructor makes a comment after each one being read)

1. slack out the objectives to the students, and call on random students to read them outloud. *Make a comment about each objective after a person reads it.*

1. in class repo for your section, make a new folder for this week and day.

1. open up that folder in Sublime Text

1. make an objectives.txt file in that folder

1. copy these objectives into that objectives.txt file and save it, commit it, push it up.

* keep the file open while the students are reading the objectives
  * Students will use GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.  
  * Students will be able to create C.R.U.D Apps in Node
  * Using Node.js server to connect MySQL database and Express and handlebar to server pages using different routes.

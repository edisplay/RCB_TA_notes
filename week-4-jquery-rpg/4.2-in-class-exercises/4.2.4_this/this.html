      	//EXAMPLE ONE
		//what is `this`?
		//`this` reference ALWAYS refers to (and holds the value of) an object—a singular object
		console.log(this);


		//EXAMPLE TWO
		/*
		when `this` is used outside of an object, it references the global scope: 
		Window {external: Object, chrome: Object, document: document, speechSynthesis: SpeechSynthesis, webkitStorageInfo: DeprecatedStorageInfo…}
		*/
		//In most cases, the value of this is determined by how a function is called

		function myFunction(){
		  console.log(this);
		}
		myFunction();

		//In the example above `this` isn't referenced anywhere so it refer backs to the global object
		//`this` is not assigned a value until an object invokes the function where this is defined. Let’s call the function where this is defined the “this Function.”


		//EXAMPLE THREE
		//When a function is called as a method of an object, its this is set to the object the method is called on.
		var someObj = {
			name: 'Red Hat',
			say: function() {
				console.log(this.name);
			}
		};

		someObj.say();
		//In the example above `this` referes to the object "someObj"


		//EXAMPLE FOUR
		//when `this` gets lost and loses scope
		var myObj = {
			name: "",
			yell: function() {
				this.name = 'Star Powerup';
				console.log(this);
				var changeName = function(newName) {
					this.name = newName;
				};
				changeName('Blue Shell');
				console.log(this);
			}
		};
		myObj.yell();
		//Wait why didn't changeName work? Why did the '.name' get added to global object but not 'myObj'
		//When 'changeName' function is run it's scope is no longer inside of the 'myObj'
		//What can we do to make sure 'this' is pointing to the correct obj.


		//Useing 'self' to fix the issue of losing scope
		var myObj = {
			name: "",
			yell: function() {
				var self = this; //Use 'self' to store 'this' currently pointing to the 'myObj'

				this.name = 'Star Powerup';
				console.log(this);
				var changeName = function(newName) {
					self.name = newName; //'self' is now the correct 'this' for 'myObj'
				};
				changeName('Blue Shell');
				console.log(this);
			}
		};
		myObj.yell();

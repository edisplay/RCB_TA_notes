# Have you read the Instructor Guide?

You should before you teach anyone anything.

Have a question? It's probably in the Instructor Guide.

Look at this file at the root of the repository:
[Instructor Guide](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/All-Lesson-Plans/blob/master/instructor_guide)

# Master Objectives (Internal Use - do not share with students - because it's a waste of time)

* Work independently or in a group on complex projects throughout the entire development lifecycle
* Implement complex logical conditions to meet an objective.
* Write clean code with proper variable names, indentation according to industry best practices

# Theme: JavaScropt Scope

# INSTRUCTOR MUST COVER!!!

```
Parts 
```

# Objectives (Slack out to students, have unique students read each one and Instructor makes a comment after each one is read)

* students will learn about Lexical Environments
* students will be introduced to JavaScope Scope 

PART ONE:

### 1. Student do (15 minutes)
Review Exercise: Fridge Magnets

* *Open this file into chrome and demo it for the class: 4.2-in-class-exercises/lesson-4.2_exercise1_fridgeMagnets folder.*

* *Slack this out to class*

```
* You are given an HTML and a folder containing different pictures.
	* A picture of a fridge
	* A folder containing pictures of the alphabet
* You are tasked to create a web page that lets you creat your own fridge message
	* The page has all the letters of the alphabet and a space button in the bottom of the page
	* Whenever a letter button is hit, the fridge will display that letter
	* Make a clear button as well that will remove all the letters on the fridge
```

### 2. Everyone do (10 minutes)

* *Open the Code to the above exercise located in 4.2-in-class-exercises/lesson-4.2_exercise1_fridgeMagnets folder.*

* *Call on a student to go over the previous exercise*

### 3. Instructor do (5 minutes)
Intro to Lexical Environments:

> Explain what Lexical Environments is.

> Lexical environments hold variables and parameters. The currently active environment is managed via a stack of execution contexts.
> Functions remember the scope they were defined in. 
> When a function is invoked, a new environment is created for is arguments and local variables. 

> English: Where your code is written in your script is important(as in term of line number), because JavaScript reads the code one line at a time in order, when the code is being read by the JavaScript engine. 

> However when the code is being run, it's the execution context that determines what is really going happen, JavaScript creates these "enviroments" that contains variables where functions can grab and use it. So functions inside of the enviroment can use variables in the environment.

> But when a function is called and invoked, it can create it's own environment that can contain variables.

### 4. Instructor do (10 minutes)

* *Instructor demos. Look in  folder.*

* *Explain what each line of the code is doing*

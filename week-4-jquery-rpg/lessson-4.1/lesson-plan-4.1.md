# Have you read the Instructor Guide?

You should before you teach anyone anything.

Have a question? It's probably in the Instructor Guide.

Look at this file at the root of the repository:
[Instructor Guide](https://github.com/RutgersCodingBootcamp/All-Lesson-Plans/blob/master/instructor_guide)

# Master Objectives (Internal Use - do not share with students - because it's a waste of time)

* Develop your vision for a website -- and then build it!
* Work independently or in a group on complex projects throughout the entire development lifecycle
* Build a frontend website either from scratch or utilizing a frontend framework (such as Bootstrap)

# Theme

Jquery

# INSTRUCTOR MUST COVER!!!

```

```

# Objectives (Slack out to students, have unique students read each one and Instructor makes a comment after each one is read)

* students will manipulate and use arrays
* students will loop over an array
* students will play rock paper scissors
* students will outline out how to play rock paper scissors
	*outlining means psuedo coding
* students will make a rock paper scissors game
* students will trigger break points in a couple of ways to "stop time"

	AT THE END WE DO THIS
	-------------------------
	maybe we build this:

	the page displays a number

	input takes in a number

	then user clicks a button

	then it makes that many buttons with a random number in each button and on the data attribute

	then when the user clicks those buttons, it adds that number to the original number displayed to the screen

	BONUS

	the buttons could subtract or add to the top number

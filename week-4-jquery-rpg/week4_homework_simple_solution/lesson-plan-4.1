	AT THE END WE DO THIS
	-------------------------
	maybe we build this:

	the page displays a number

	input takes in a number

	then user clicks a button

	then it makes that many buttons with a random number in each button and on the data attribute

	then when the user clicks those buttons, it adds that number to the original number displayed to the screen

	BONUS

	the buttons could subtract or add to the top number

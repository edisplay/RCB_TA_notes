# Have you read the Instructor Guide?

You should before you teach anyone anything.

Have a question? It's probably in the Instructor Guide.

look at this file at the root of the repository:

#Object CONSTRUCTOR

Let's make two minions
What sucks about this?
How can we DRY up this code?
Minion!

#I DO 

Show them how to make the minion.

```
var Minion = function(name, color, eyes){
	this.name = name;
	this.color = color;
	this.eyes = eyes;
	this.mutate = function(){
		this.color = "purple"
		return this.name + " is now " + this.color;
  }
  this.revert = function(){
  	this.color = "yellow"
  	return this.name + " is now " + this.color;
  }
}

```

Now have them make a few new minions. Show them how to do so first. Have them add a function called changeName.


#WE DO 

Together lets make a Car constructor. So we are going to make a Car constructor. This car constructor should have a make, model, year, hp. It should be able to return its full name, ex: "1967 Ford Mustang". Its should be able to be supercharged, which will ramp up the hp by 150hp. 

```
var Car = function (make, model, year, hp) {
	this.make = make;
	this.model = model;
	this.year = year;
	this.hp = hp;
	this.fullName = function(){
		// this.year + " " + this.make + " " + this.model
		return [this.year, this.make, this.model].join(" ")
	};
	this.supercharge = function(){
		this.hp += 150
		return this.
	};
}


var Person = function(firstName, lastName, age) {
	this.firstName = name;
	this.LastName = lastName;
	this.age = age;
	this.fullName = function(){
		return [this.firstName, this.lastName].join(" ")
	};
}

```

#YOU DO 

Lets tie these two things together!!! Lets make a Garage constructor. People are building car collections like hot cakes. The Garage constructor should have the following attributes: owner - which will be a Person object, cars - which will start as an empty array, it will hold Car objects. addCar - which will be a behavior that adds a new Car to the cars array. changeOwner - which will transfer ownership to a new Person. 


```

var Garage = function(owner) {
	this.owner = owner;
	this.cars = [];
	this.addCar = function(car){
		this.cars.push(car)
	};
	this.changeOwner = function(newOwner){
		this.owner = newOwner
	};
}
```

Review!


#BANK EX #1
# Create an Account

An account should have the following attributes:

- a balance (starts at 0) -> `balance`

An account should be able to:

- deposit money -> `deposit`
	- should deposit money into the current account
- withdraw money -> `withdraw`
	- should withdraw money from the current account but only if enough is available

# Create a Bank

A Bank should have the following attributes:

- a name -> `name`
- an address -> `address`
- accounts -> `accounts`
	- you decide how this should be represented (array vs object)
	- a bank starts with a checking AND savings account

A Bank should be able to:

- display its information -> `information`
	- should return the banks name and address
- make a transaction - `makeTransaction`
	- should accept three arguments -> a transaction type, an account type, and an amount
	- should use the appropriate account functions to perform a transaction (deposit or withdrawal)
	- should render the new balances
- display the account balances -> `render`
	- should take the current balances of the savings and checking accounts, then update the DOM display of the bank account balances


```
var Account = function() {
	this.balance = 0;
}

Account.prototype.deposit = function(amount) {
	if (amount > 0) {
		this.balance += amount;
	}
};

Account.prototype.withdraw = function(amount) {
	if (amount <= this.balance) {
		this.balance -= amount;
	}
};

var Bank = function(name, address) {
	this.name = name;
	this.address = address;
	this.accounts = {
		checking: new Account(),
		savings: new Account()
	};
};

Bank.prototype.information = function() {
	return this.name + '\n' + this.address;
};

Bank.prototype.makeTransaction = function(transaction, account, amount) {
	var currentAccount = this.accounts[account];
	currentAccount[transaction](parseInt(amount));
	this.render();
};

```
